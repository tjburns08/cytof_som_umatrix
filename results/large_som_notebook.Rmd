This is the notebook for the large SOM project. It will initially contain
the large SOM and umatrix visualization pursuits and eventually contain 
the growing neural gas pursuits unless I decide to make this a different
script entirely.

Today's task is to plot a SOM and U-matrix. There are three datasets with 
which I can work. The first is the TSORA dataset, or at least a single file
thereof. The second is the Levin 32-dim dataset, with which I have experience
already grouping. The third is the Mosmann rare subset datset. I need to do
the TSORA dataset to show Henrik what it looks like. So I'll begin there. 
This will help just because I know the datset so damn well. I'll then move
to the other publicly available datasets.
